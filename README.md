## <p align="center">Hello there!</p>

### Intro

The name's Ren/Shizu. At first programming is simply just my hobby and this is where I usually put all my hobby projects in.
I am now a Computer Science student, so I guess it is now mixed with fairly professional things. I still keep my hobby projects here, though.

I primarily use Python and Javascript (Typescript), but I wish to delve more into other languages.
There, I make web apps, sometimes libraries and CLI apps.
